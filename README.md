## Team

## General description
This project is based off Dota battle chess. We will create a similar game with the characters being based of warriors from the early 11th century. In this game, the players set up their characters in their respective corners. Once the battle begins the characters will move toward each other and attack. Between rounds players can purchase items and upgrades for their characters. The game is over once a player loses by too large of a collective margin. Unlike dota chess it will be strictly 1 on 1 games.

### Deliverables

* 5 Characters with unique capabilites (movements and/or attacks)
